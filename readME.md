Mark has only a certain amount to spend, and he wants to maximize the number of toys he buys with this money.

Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of toys Mark can buy? For example, if  and Mark has  to spend, he can buy items  for , or  for  units of currency. He would choose the first group of  items.

##Pairs
You will be given an array of integers and a target value. Determine the number of pairs of array elements that have a difference equal to a target value.

For example, given an array of [1, 2, 3, 4] and a target value of 1, we have three values meeting the condition:2-1, 3-2 and 4-3

##Equalize
Karl has an array of integers. He wants to reduce the array until all remaining elements are equal. Determine the minimum number of elements to delete to reach his goal.

For example, if his array is , we see that he can delete the  elements  and  leaving . He could also delete both twos and either the  or the , but that would take  deletions. The minimum number of deletions is .
